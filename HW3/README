# DAV_hw03.ipynb

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook (`DAV_hw03.ipynb`) is designed to perform a series of data analysis and machine learning tasks, focusing primarily on generating and evaluating quadratic decision boundaries. The notebook includes various sections with code cells and markdown cells that guide the user through the process of loading data, performing calculations, and visualizing results.

## Structure of the Notebook

### 1. Setup and Imports
This section includes the necessary library imports and initial setup required for the rest of the notebook. Ensure you have the following libraries installed:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

### 2. Data Generation
The notebook provides code to generate synthetic datasets with specific means and covariance matrices. These datasets are used to demonstrate the decision boundary generation and classification tasks.

### 3. Quadratic Decision Boundaries
This section covers the computation of quadratic decision boundaries. It involves:

- Calculating means and covariance matrices for different classes.
- Using these statistics to form quadratic decision boundaries.

### 4. Classification and Evaluation
In this section, the notebook:

- Trains classifiers using the generated data.
- Evaluates the performance of these classifiers by calculating the number of misclassified points.
- Displays actual labels, predicted labels, and probabilities for each data point.

### 5. Visualization
The final section of the notebook focuses on visualizing the results. It plots:

- The generated datasets.
- The decision boundaries.
- The misclassified points.
